# We include in MindSet: Vision two famous illusions related to lightness: the Lightness Contrast Illusion and the Adelson Checker Shadow Illusion. To facilitate testing for these and other lightness-related effects, we suggest using this dataset, whose purpose is not to elicit any illusion in humans or in DNNs but to train a network (or, with our suggested method, a decoder attached to a network) to output the grayscale value of a target pixel. Each image is composed of 20 overlapping items amongst the following types of shapes (circle, circle sector, circle segment, ellipse, rectangle with straight and rounded corners, heptagon, irregular polygon composed of a random number of edges from 3 to 10). Each shape is randomize according to their position, dimension, orientation, and grayscale filled color. We place 20 items to be sure that most space in the canvas is filled by some item, but in the end only few of them are visible. This results in a chaotic canvas with many different shapes with varying grayscale but with coherent pattern (as opposed to, for example, having each pixel of a different random grayscale value). In order to target a specific pixel to be predicted by the decoder, a small white vertical arrow (the `marker') of fixed size is placed randomly on the canvas. The arrow points to the pixel whose value can be used for prediction. Notice that while the images are commonly normalized from -1 to 1 before being fed into the network, the targeted pixel value to predict is in the 0-255 range.

Each image is resized according to parameters specified by the user and then reoriented into both an upright and a 180-degree inverted configuration. Furthermore, it is either 'Thatcherized' or unaltered. To `Thatcherize' an image we compute the landmarks of the eyes and the mouth, compute the bounding rectangle for each, and rotate them around their centre of mass. Blurring on the edge is applied to minimize artefacts.

# Two target lines (red and blue) are placed across a railway track pattern. In the `illusory' condition, the target lines have the same length (varying across samples). In the `scrambled' condition, the target lines have different length, are still placed horizontally one on top of the other, but all the other segments are randomly placed across the canvas. We include an additional condition, `different lengths`, in which the railway track pattern is used on target lines of different lengths. The railway track pattern for the `illusory' and `different lengths` conditions is composed of converging segments (with a varying degree of convergence), and horizontal segments (randomly placed at different horizontal position). For the three conditions, the user can specify the number of horizontal segments to use.

# We developed our version of the Leuven Camouflaged Shapes from Torfs et al. (2014) by generating 5 irregular polygons and adding a set of lines to camouflage them. This consisted of pre-generated polygons and the polygons camouflaged by adding a variety of lines. Some of the added lines extends the lines that composed the polygon itself, and some have a slightly different slope than the polygon's lines.

# We modified a dataset of line drawings (by default the line drawings in Baker et al. (2018), but the user can specify a different dataset). Each linedrawing is modified by generating complementary images that have complementary segments removed. These stimuli are generated by overlapping a grid on the line drawing and deleting complementary sections. The user can specify the grid orientation, the distance between each grid row and column, and thickness of each cell. To test whether DNNs achieve human-level recognition of segmented images, a standard ImageNet classification test can be performed. Importantly, humans find complementary images like these hard to distinguish, and indeed, complementary images produce equivalent priming to repeated images, highlighting how the visual system treats them as equivalent Biederman (1987).

# The dataset consists of images containing simple two parts. There are three `split' conditions and two `familiarity' conditions. The `split' conditions are: `no split` in which two parts are touching at one point but not overlapping; `natural split`, in which two parts are separated; `unnatural split` in which the two parts are touching each other as in the `no split` condition, but one of the parts is `cut' and separated from the rest. The items are silhouettes uniformly coloured on a uniform background, and they can be either familiar or unfamiliar shapes. The familiar shapes consist of the following objects: circle, square, rectangle, triangle, heptagon, and a 50-degree arc segment; the unfamiliar shapes consist of blob-like objects. Within each familiar/unfamiliar condition, all possible combinations of two shapes are used (e.g. a triangle with a rectangle). Configuration parameters include the distance between the pieces in the `unnatural split' and `natural split' condition, the colour of the items, and the number of different blob- like objects to use for the unfamiliar condition.

# 2D line segments recreated through vector graphics based on Kubilius et al. 2017. A feature dimension (such as the curvature of a Geon) is altered from a singular value (e.g. straight contour with 0 curvature) to two different values (e.g. slightly curved or very curved). The `reference` condition is the item with the intermediate value; the `MP change` condition consists of the sample with a greater non-singular value (that is, from slight curvature to greater curvature, which corresponds to a MP change), and the `NAP` change condition includes the samples with the singular value (that is, from slight curvature to non curvature, which corresponds to a NAP change).

# Based on Doerig & Herzog (2019), code adapted with authors' permission. Consists of a 'vernier' stimulus (two parallel lines segment with some offset) placed either inside or outside a set of random flankers (squares, circles, hexagons, octagons, stars, diamonds). Each configuration has from 1 to 7 columns and from 1 to 3 rows of flankers with a variety of same/different shape patterns used. The vernier can be left/right oriented. User can specify whether the size of the flankers vary or is fixed across samples. REF: Doerig, A †, and A † Herzog.

# Adapted from Biscione & Bowers (2023). The dataset consisted of sets of paired images. Each set includes four conditions: a base condition (single dots), and composite conditions (orientation, proximity, and linearity). The `single dots` condition consists of paired images in which each image contains a single dot placed at a different location. In the composite conditions, one or more dots are added to both images of the base condition, in the same locations, in such a way that it would elicit different emergent properties when combined with the original single dots. In the orientation and proximity conditions, the added dot results in different orientation/proximity features. In the linearity condition (generated by adding a dot to the orientation condition), the added dot would either be placed on a straight line with the other two dots or on a different path. Each dot was constrained to be located at a distance of at least 20 pixels from one another, and 40 pixels from the border. REF:Biscione, Valerio, and Jeffrey S. Bowers.
